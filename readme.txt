This module provide enhancements to Drupal 7 file field module.

For the moment, it enables to open the file in a new window by overriding the theme function.

Rather than using template.php, it uses a module theme registry override. This approach which enables to use the customisation throughout multi-site installations (you don't have to copy it in every template.php).

Enjoy!
